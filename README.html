<h1>Structjour, a journal helper for day traders</h1>

<p>This saves me some hours per day of documenting my trades. It is currenlty limited to exactly what I personally need. </p>
<p>It will read the DAS Pro export of the trades window to csv form and 
out put an excel file with transactions sorted to within trades and placed on the page.</p>

<p>Then structjour prompts for an image for each trade and places the image on the page next to
the information needed in order to review it</p>

<p>At version 0.0.1, the structural componenets are not in their places, but its working for me with some utility.</p>

<p>Version 1 ill be a console app and will interrogate the user for needed info. (stops, targets, open trades, strategy). It may add some other input platforms, 
beginning with IB statements (html, csv, xlsx). It may begin to incorporate other input from DAS (eg the position window export) or IB to 
figure open trades without asking. The priority is functionality for reviewing trades for me and users who use DAS Pro or Interactive Brokers. </p>

<p>Version 2 will be a windowed application, or possibly a web hosted application at ZeroSubstance.com. The problem with the web version is how to avoid clients' sensitve info.  Version 3 will be enhanced by database functionality to save and regurgitate info over time.</p>

<p>My purpose for creating this application has mmm parts: 
<ol>
  <li> Documenting trades is time consuming but necessary. This saves time and allows me to focus on the trade, not the procedure.</li>
  <li> I plan to distribute. The code is under a GNU license. It is too soon to decide if there is any commercial potential, but I think there will be. 
  I will offer it to my compadres at BearBulls first and, hopefully, get use cases and usability suggestions. Although, as I'm using public github, its available.</li>
  <li>All of this is greati learning for me and I love to do it. The list of things I am learning is long and growing everyday, four times a day.</li>
  <li>The experience gained from this could point me to other programming gigs. </li>
  
</ol>
